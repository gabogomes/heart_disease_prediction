Organization:

1) Models without and with scaling, one run and compare ROC AUC plots;

2) Models without scaling, several runs and average over k-fold Cross Validation;

3) Multi-layer perceptron model;

4) Neural Network using different number of layers, probably can use grid search for hyperparameter tuning.
